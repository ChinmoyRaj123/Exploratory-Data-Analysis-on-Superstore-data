## Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis
* The Sales of product increases when Discount is given, but Profit goes down.
* California and New York are the ahead of others in terms of sales and profit. Hence we should focus selling more products in those states.
* ‘Technology’ category has more profit than ‘Furniture’ and ‘Office Supplies’. Whereas, Office Supplies has lowest sales and profit, so we need to focus on this category more.
* Furniture Category is in loss as profit is lowest although its sales is high.
* Sales of ‘Fasteners’, ‘Labels’ and ‘Art’ is very low. Hence, we need to focus in increasing its sales.
* Central region is the only region with negative profit in ‘Furniture’ and ‘Office Supplies’ category. This is due to high discount given by the Texas and Illinois state having very low sales rate.
* Hence, to get good profit in any business we have to focus on increasing sales but not giving more discount. And also we have to increase sales in highest profit making areas.
